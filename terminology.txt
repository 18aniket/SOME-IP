pduR

PduR stands for Protocol Data Unit Router in the Service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP) protocol. PduR is responsible for routing SOME/IP protocol data units (PDUs) between different service instances and clients in the system. It is responsible for managing the routing tables, managing the connection state, and handling the flow control of the PDUs. PduR also provides a mechanism for handling service discovery and service binding, which enables clients to find and connect to the appropriate service instances.

SOME/IP Transport Protocol (TP) modul

The SOME/IP Transport Protocol (TP) module is a component within the SOME/IP protocol stack that is responsible for the reliable and efficient transport of PDUs (Protocol Data Units) over the network. It provides a number of features such as error correction, flow control, and message segmentation/reassembly.

The SOME/IP TP module is based on the ISO-OSI Transport Layer (layer 4) and it is responsible for ensuring that the PDUs are delivered to their intended destination in a reliable and efficient manner. It uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the underlying transport protocol, which allows for low overhead and high throughput, making it well suited for use in automotive systems.

The SOME/IP TP module also provides mechanisms for flow control, which allows for the efficient use of network resources and prevents overloading of the system. It also provides error correction mechanisms such as retransmission of lost or corrupted PDUs, to ensure the integrity of the data being transmitted.

Overall, the SOME/IP TP module plays an important role in the overall functionality of the SOME/IP protocol by ensuring that PDUs are delivered reliably and efficiently over the network, thus enabling the communication between service instances and clients.

Example for MTU.
An original SOME/IP message of 5571 bytes payload has to be transmitted.
The Length field of this original SOME/IP message is set to 8 + 5571 bytes.
This original SOME/IP message will now be segmented into 5 consecutive SOME/
IP segments. Every payload of these segments carries at most 1392 bytes in this
example.
JUSTIFICATION:
The maximum size of a SOME/IP message can vary depending on the implementation and the underlying transport protocol. In general, the maximum size of a SOME/IP message should not exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the underlying network, which is typically around 1500 bytes for Ethernet networks. However, this can be larger or smaller depending on the specific implementation and network configuration.

General
SOME/IP-SD is used to
• Locate service instances.
• Detect if service instances are running.
• Implement the Publish/Subscribe handling.
Inside the vehicular network service instance locations are commonly known; therefore, the state of the service instance is of primary concern. The location of the service
(i.e. IP-Address, transport protocol, and port number) are of secondary concern.
